A few weeks ago, I looked at my GitHub contributions and, I won’t deny it, felt a certain discomfort seeing that I wasn’t producing in my personal projects. I believe a lot of this came from creative burnout, something that happens from time to time. But this is normal, something everyone faces at some point.

What motivated me to start this personal challenge of committing once a day was, firstly, the desire to improve myself through consistency. I believe that moving forward, even if it’s just one step a day, means there’s progress, and this is the key to achieving success in life.

Another important point is that I have countless projects I’ve always wanted to develop, which end up on hold. For instance:

- Developing a website focused on the Mass Effect universe (of which I’m a big fan)
- Creating an application using the Spotify API
- Building a project manager that’s a mix between Jira and GitHub Projects

Currently, I’m focused on web development projects, but at some point, I’d like to return to my digital art projects (as I’m a digital design student) and stay consistent in my journey toward my goals.

Best regards,

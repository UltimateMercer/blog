On October 14, 2024, I decided I wanted to create a blog. This idea came from a long-standing desire, built up over numerous personal projects, to write articles to share my studies and experiences. Beyond documenting my projects, I see the blog as a way to improve myself in different areas.

My goal is, as always, to practice my technical skills (I’m a web developer and a digital design student) and to also enhance other skills, such as writing (I'm currently starting my thesis project) and communication in general, as I’ve always been quite shy and introverted — something that often holds me back.

I believe that by sharing some ideas and projects, I can grow both personally and professionally. Additionally, depending on this blog's reach, I may even be able to help others.

I already have a personal website, but it functions more as a resume/portfolio (nothing stops me from merging the two projects in the future).

Another important influence is the book _"Show Your Work"_ by Austin Kleon. In one chapter, the author says we should find our own voice and that the only way to do so is by practicing.

With that in mind, I plan to use this space to share ideas, projects, and other topics that interest me.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for your time.

Best regards,  
Julian Silva da Cunha
